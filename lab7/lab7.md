# Lab 7 report

1. The site is a site of company "E-education"
2. "E-eudcation" offers online tutoring for university students. They can study at home as they do in the campus.
3. The 3 processes:
   - Explore: users can find courses offered.
   - Absorbing information: Users can find the overview of the courses and preview lecture notes. They can know what they will study during the lecture.
   - Follow instructions: Users can buy a course. To do this, the UI will guide them in what to input.
4. My semantic network will contain tutors and courses.
4. I will include 3 sketches of my website.
4. Heuristics:
   - Consistency: We find the same theme (image and logo) at the top of each page. The menu bar is sticky at the left-hand side in each page.
   - Familiar language and metaphors: The words chosen for the menu will be: home, pay, courses. The words chosen for the button is **pay**.
   - Simple design: It will be easy to view a list of courses at the page **courses**, and users can find details of courses just click them.
   - Freedom: Allow users to cancel an unpaid course.
   - Flexibility: Users can enter a course title to find it instead of view the long course list.
   - Recall Recognition: In the course page, each course section will have a title, a tutor name, a brief description let the users know the short information about the course.
   - Clear state: When the user press the button pay, there will be a confirmation message to show that the paid course is non-refundable.
   - Error prevention: When paying the course, the UI will give the list of courses the user can buy instead of letting users input the course name.
   - Error Recovery: If a user already bought a course and try to buy the same course, the UI will cancel the course payment automatically.
   - Help: There will be a global help with an item at the top of the page explaining the website. When you click the help, it will pop-up a modal to show information.
